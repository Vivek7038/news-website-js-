        The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy
        and sell crypto on its platform..

      <p>
        After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in
        October 2020, PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively
        transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other
        wallets and exchanges.As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select
         U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the
        coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin</p>
        <br />

        BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC
        $74.58. <br/> <p>In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can
            spend it via Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company has
            been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial
            Services for the conduct.</p><br/>
        
         <p> Users would simply need to log in to their
        accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to start
        transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time
        ID verification before the procedure.</p>
        <br><p> Crypto transfers to recipients
        outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective
        blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such
        fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient
        address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also
        not charge fees for incoming transfers,</p>
        <br><p>The company is also working to
        integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank
        digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring
        the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin."
        The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin
        within the source code of the company's iPhone app.</p>
